              The counselling sessions take place while the Whitehawk Community
              Caf√© is running. The cafe offers foodbank clients and local
              people, a cuppa, company, fruit and vegetables and bakery goods.

              The approach is collaborative between therapist and client,
              offering space to reflect on issues or changes they may like to
              make in their lives. It is person centred and based on an
              empowerment model.

            <li className="text-1xl mb-8 ml-4">
              Clients can speak briefly on the phone or by email to arrange a
              50-minute introductory session. This will help us to see if
              counselling is the best thing for you at this time.
